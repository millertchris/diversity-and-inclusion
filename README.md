# Diversity & Inclusion
## MLK Day Project
At Mightily, we observe Martin Luther King Day by closing the office and volunteering our time towards initiatives that impact our communities of color.

This year, we decided to spend this time investing into our Diversity & Inclusion committee by creating a set of goals for 2021.
